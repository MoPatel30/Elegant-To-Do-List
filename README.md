# A very simple, but elegant, To-Do list Web-App

As the title states, this is a very simple, but elegant, To-Do List web-app.
This web-app is being create for me to track tasks I need to complete, but more importantly to practice full-stack development. 


I am using this project to gain a better understanding and get more practice with RestAPI building, Database usage, etc. I also get more practice with Firebase and MongoDB, which is a plus.


In addition, I want to try to make this simple web-app look visually pleasing and have cool animations. I think this is the perfect project to get better at CSS animations and dive deeper into css in general.


## Languages, Tools, & Services
